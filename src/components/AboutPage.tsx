                <p>
                  The Hoppy Dog was born from a simple observation: New Hampshire dog owners needed a place where they could enjoy quality time while their pets socialized safely, especially during those brutal New England winters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our founders, Jim and Theresa Robinson, lifelong Granite Staters and dog lovers who saw an opportunity to create a space that serves both the four-legged and two-legged members of our community. After traveling around visiting dog parks, they realized there was a gap in the market for a premium indoor experience right here in the "Live Free or Die" state.
